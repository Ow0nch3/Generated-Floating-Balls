An animated generated ball bouncing sequence formed by using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.
create a html file; Html.html or name it Ballbouncing.html any works for me.
Then open the file in; Sublime text or Vscode trust me any one's fine.
and start typing very single piece of code i did, it'll be fun:
I started by written the name, or title as they call it in html.
Then created the styling of the box which the balls would bounce within and around it.
Later created the balls with code, or generate which is usually what they call them this days thanks to artificial intellince a.k.a AI.
And the finishing touches; runing the code, debugging the code, checking for errors.
